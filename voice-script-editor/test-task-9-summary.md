# Task 9 Implementation Summary: Scenes Panel and Navigation

## âœ… Implementation Complete

### What was implemented:

#### 1. Scene Detection Utility (`src/utils/sceneDetection.ts`)
- **Scene Detection**: Automatically detects scene headings from script content
- **Supported Patterns**: INT./EXT., FADE IN/OUT, CUT TO, MONTAGE, FLASHBACK, etc.
- **Scene Data Structure**: Each scene includes ID, heading, position, line number, content, and estimated duration
- **Navigation Support**: Functions to find scenes by cursor position
- **Display Helpers**: Scene titles, descriptions, and duration formatting

#### 2. Scenes Panel Component (`src/components/ScenesPanel.tsx`)
- **Auto-Detection**: Automatically detects and displays scenes from script content
- **Real-time Updates**: Updates scene list as user writes/edits script
- **Active Scene Highlighting**: Shows which scene the cursor is currently in
- **Click Navigation**: Click any scene to jump to it in the editor
- **Collapsible Interface**: Can be collapsed to save space
- **Scene Information**: Shows scene number, title, description, line number, and estimated duration
- **Empty State**: Helpful message when no scenes are detected

#### 3. Script Editor Integration (`src/components/ScriptEditor.tsx`)
- **Left Sidebar**: Added collapsible left sidebar containing the scenes panel
- **Toggle Button**: "Hide/Show Scenes" button to control sidebar visibility
- **Cursor Tracking**: Tracks cursor position to highlight active scene
- **Scene Navigation**: Implements click-to-navigate functionality
- **Responsive Layout**: Sidebar adapts to screen size and can be hidden

### Key Features:

#### Scene Detection Intelligence
- Recognizes standard screenplay scene headings (INT./EXT.)
- Detects transitions (FADE IN, CUT TO, DISSOLVE TO)
- Handles special sequences (MONTAGE, FLASHBACK, DREAM SEQUENCE)
- Creates default scene if no headings found
- Estimates scene duration based on content length

#### Navigation Functionality
- **Click to Navigate**: Click any scene in panel to jump to that location
- **Active Scene Tracking**: Current scene is highlighted based on cursor position
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Editor scrolls to the selected scene
- **Cursor Positioning**: Places cursor at the start of the selected scene

#### User Experience
- **Visual Feedback**: Active scene highlighted with amber colors
- **Scene Information**: Shows line numbers, descriptions, and durations
- **Responsive Design**: Works on different screen sizes
- **Keyboard Accessible**: All interactions work with keyboard navigation

### Test File Created:
- `test-scenes-panel.html`: Complete test environment with sample multi-scene script
- Pre-loaded with realistic screenplay content including multiple scenes
- Tests all functionality: detection, navigation, highlighting, and interaction

### Requirements Fulfilled:

âœ… **6.1**: Add left sidebar with scenes list
- Implemented collapsible left sidebar with scenes panel

âœ… **6.2**: Auto-detect scenes from script content and display in panel  
- Scene detection service automatically finds and lists all scenes
- Updates in real-time as content changes

âœ… **6.3**: Add click-to-navigate functionality to jump to scenes
- Click any scene to navigate to that position in the editor
- Cursor positioning and scrolling implemented

### Testing Instructions:

1. **Build the project**: `npm run build`
2. **Start preview server**: `npm run preview`
3. **Open test page**: Navigate to `http://localhost:4173/test-scenes-panel.html`

### Expected Test Results:

1. **Scene Detection**: Should detect 6+ scenes from the sample script
2. **Scene List**: Left sidebar shows all detected scenes with titles and descriptions
3. **Active Highlighting**: Current scene highlighted as you move cursor through script
4. **Click Navigation**: Clicking any scene jumps to that location in editor
5. **Real-time Updates**: Adding new scene headings immediately appear in panel
6. **Sidebar Toggle**: Hide/Show button works to collapse/expand sidebar

### Technical Implementation:

- **Scene Detection**: Regex-based pattern matching for various scene heading types
- **Position Tracking**: Character position mapping for accurate navigation
- **React Integration**: Hooks for real-time updates and state management
- **Performance**: Efficient scene detection with minimal re-computation
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support

# Task 12 Implementation Summary: Script Deletion and Data Management

## Overview
Successfully implemented script deletion functionality with confirmation dialog as specified in task 12. The implementation includes a delete button on script cards, confirmation dialog before deletion, proper localStorage management, and comprehensive testing.

## Implementation Details

### 1. ConfirmationDialog Component
- **File**: `src/components/ConfirmationDialog.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Reusable modal dialog with backdrop blur
  - Destructive action styling (red colors for delete operations)
  - Keyboard support (Escape key to cancel)
  - Prevents body scroll when open
  - Customizable title, message, and button text
  - Loading state support for async operations

### 2. Dashboard Component Updates
- **File**: `src/components/Dashboard.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added delete button to script cards (appears on hover)
  - Integrated confirmation dialog state management
  - Added delete confirmation and cancellation handlers
  - Implemented async delete operation with loading states
  - Added error handling for delete failures
  - Proper event handling to prevent script opening when delete is clicked

### 3. Script Card Enhancements
- **Delete Button**: 
  - Positioned in top-right corner of each script card
  - Only visible on hover (opacity transition)
  - Red styling to indicate destructive action
  - Trash icon for clear visual indication
  - Prevents event bubbling to avoid opening script

### 4. Data Management
- **ScriptService Integration**: 
  - Uses existing `deleteScript` method
  - Proper error handling and user feedback
  - Automatic refresh of script list after deletion
  - Maintains data consistency in localStorage

## Testing Implementation

### Test File: `test-script-deletion.html`
